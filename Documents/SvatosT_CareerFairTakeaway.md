    I think the most important part I learned about the social networking presentation is the importance of not purely trying to sell yourself.
    Every speech class and business class I have had always mentions how this is the chance to sell yourself so to go all out.
    It was surprising, yet inspiring, to hear that it should never be a priority, as you will sell yourself by establishing that connection.
    Tell them the most important bits about you and your interests in the company, but make sure to ask them open-ended questions to get to know them and the potential opportunities at the company.
    Who knows, maybe you will learn about an opportunity that is right up your alley or that you will avoid that one nightmare job!
